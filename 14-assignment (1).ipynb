    "#### The WEB API is the optimal choice for developing resource-oriented services that use HTTP/Restful and integrate nicely with MVC-based applications. For more specific, lighter-weight services, a WEB API is a preferable solution. The WEB API is compatible with any text format, including XML, and is far quicker than the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WCF was developed to facilitate the development of SOAP-based services and interfaces. Because WCF is SOAP-based, which means it communicates using a standard XML structure through HTTP, it may result in more unsatisfactory performance.\n",
